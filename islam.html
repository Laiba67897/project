            Eid al-Fitr is the earlier of the two official holidays celebrated within Islam. Eid al-Fitar is celebrated by Muslims worldwide because it marks the end of the month-long dawn-to-sunset fasting of Ramadanid al-Fitr is one of two major holidays celebrated by Muslims and commemorates the end of the holy month of Ramadan, in which Muslims fast daily from before dawn until sunset. It is commemorated by a large, community-wide prayer service in the morning, followed by meals and conversation with friends and family. In South Asia, sheer kurma barfi, halwa, kheer, and Shahi tukda are most common dishes during Eid. Chomchoms, barfis, gulabjamuns and different types of pithas as well as roshmalai are popular. These are not only consumed inside houses but also presented to relatives and friends when visiting them on Eid-ul-Fitr. Eid al-Fitr means “the feast of breaking the fast.” The fast, in this instance, is Ramadan, which recalls the revealing of the Quran to Prophet Muhammad and requires Muslims to fast from sunrise to sundown for a month.

                The date of Eid al-Adha is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, so it varies each year. However, Eid al-Adha falls on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah—the last month of the Islamic calendar—and lasts for four days.
Eid al-Adha or the Feast of Sacrifice is the second of the two main holidays celebrated in Islam. In Islamic tradition, it honor’s the willingness of Abraham to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to God's command. Both Ishmael and Isaac are referred to with the honorific title "Sacrifice of God”. Known as the “Feast of Sacrifice”, the revered observance coincides with the final rites of the annual Hajj in Saudi Arabia. Eid al-Adha commemorates the Quranic tale of Prophet Abrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael as an act of obedience to God. Eid al-Adha, or the Feast of Sacrifice, is a major holiday celebrated by Muslims worldwide for three to four days. Most Muslims will attend the special prayers held at major mosques and Islamic centers in the United States and throughout the world.

                    One of the five pillars of Islam central to Muslim belief, Hajj is the pilgrimage to Mecca that every Muslim must make at least once in their lifetime if they are able; it is the most spiritual event that a Muslim experiences, observing rituals in the most sacred places in the Islamic world. Hajj is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, the holiest city for Muslims. Hajj is a mandatory religious duty for Muslims that must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by all
The term hajah or hajjah is the female version of haji. These terms have existed for centuries, appearing in the Koran and coming to the English language in the 1600s. 
The present pattern of Hajj was established by Muhammad. However, according to the Quran, elements of Hajj trace back to the time of Abraham. According to Islamic tradition, Abraham was ordered by God to leave his wife Hajar and his son Ishmael alone in the desert of ancient Mecca. Hajj takes place each year between the 8th and 12th of Dhul Hijjah. Muslims use the lunar calendar, so the corresponding Gregorian date will vary year to year.

Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting, prayer, reflection, and communityIt is the month in which it is believed that the Holy Qur'an was sent down from heaven "as a guidance for men and women, a declaration of direction, and a means of salvation." During this month, Muslims observe a strict fast from dawn until sunset. Muslims believe that in A.D. 610, the angel Gabriel appeared to Prophet Muhammad and revealed to him the Quran, the Islamic holy book. That revelation, Laylat Al Qadar—or the “Night of Power”—is believed to have occurred during Ramadan. Muslims fast during that month as a way to commemorate the revelation of the Quran. The exact start date of Islam's holiest month depends on when local Islamic authorities declare the sighting of the new moon. Ramadan, the holiest month of the Muslim calendar,
